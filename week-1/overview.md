#Introduction to Audio Signal Processing#

	A field that focus on computational method for intentionally altering a sound.

	So, it takes audio signals which are represented in digital or analog formats and are passed to some automated control or human control to synthesize sound again.

1. Difference between Digital and Analog Audio Signal?

	##An analog sound##

	is usually electrical. It is a continous function of voltage level showing air pressure waveform of sound. 

	##An digital signal##

	However is binary number representation of air pressure waveform of sound. It uses microprocessor and computers for its analysis and computation. Usually analog sound signals are converted into digital sound signals by modern audio system.

	##Applications of Audio SIgnal Processing##
	How is audio stored??

	So, how your voice is recorded and retrieved?? 

	Digital representation of sound are stored as digital or mechanical inscription in media such as "CD" and are re-created again.

	##Audio coding or data compression.##

	How is size of audio compressed in size or changed in bandwidth.

	There are two types of audio coding. One is lossless where we don't loose any information and another loses some audio information but which hopefully is not relatable informations.

	Example:
	converting a "wav" format of audio file to "mp3" where "mp3" is less sized format.
and no information is lost during the compression and hence size os also reduced.

	##Transformations##

	Post production of music or audacity includes transforming audio signal. As you may have heard of audacity, it does transformations. Some examples: shifting, streching, 3D audio effects, equalizing etc. 
	## Synthesis ##
	
	Obtaining new audio by applying few computation in the input audio signal.
	example: subtractive synthesis, sampling, additive synthesis etc.


Note: Transformation and synthesis techniques are used in this course.

	## Description
	Extracting meaningful concept from audio is example of this application. Example: getting loudness, pitch, emotions from description.
